# libmath-finite     
**libmath-finite** intends to solve the `__xxx_finite` symbols missed problem due to `glibc` upgrade. It generally happens when distribute your pre-built binray(`.a/.so/executable`) from `glibc<2.31` build enviornment to `glibc>=2.31` systems, such as `Debian 10 -> Debian 11`, or `Ubuntu18.04 -> Ubuntu20.04`. [Math changes in glibc 2.31](https://sourceware.org/pipermail/libc-alpha/2020-May/113773.html) also discusses the problem.          
It's a very simple library, which only wraps functions of the standard math library `libm`. **Many thanks to **Ã‰tienne** who proposes the idea in [Link errors with -ffast-math (-ffinite-math-only) and glibc 2.31](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63261220/link-errors-with-ffast-math-ffinite-math-only-and-glibc-2-31)**.    

## Why need it
Please read [Undefined reference to `__xxx_finite` - why and how?](./doc/undefined_reference_to__xxx_finite__why_and_how.md).       

## How to use
There're various ways to use it. The simplest way is just copy the sources into your project and compile them together. Alternativesly build static/shared library to and link them. Read [Undefined reference to `__xxx_finite` - why and how?](./doc/undefined_reference_to__xxx_finite__why_and_how.md) for more details.        

- Build static library

```bash
$ gcc -c -o libmath-finite.o libmath-finite.c
$ ar rcs libmath-finite.a libmath-finite.o
```

- Build shared library

```bash
$ gcc -c -fPIC -o libmath-finite.o libmath-finite.c
$ gcc -shared -fPIC -o libmath-finite.so libmath-finite.o -lm
```
